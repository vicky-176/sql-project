🎬 IMDB SQL Project
This project focuses on analyzing the IMDB movie dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights from structured movie data. The database includes details about movies, genres, actors, directors, and ratings.

📌 About the Project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL by performing complex queries on a real-world movie dataset. Through this analysis, we uncover patterns and trends in the film industry, such as rating behavior, popular genres, and notable contributors.

🧩 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD below represents the relational structure of the IMDB dataset used in this project. It outlines the relationships between tables like movies, ratings, genres, people, and roles.
